                        class="fa fa-external-link"></i></sup></a>. During my degree I completed 3 seperate projects
            using Python. I attempted to simulate physical phenomena in Python in each of these projects. The first was
            simulating the solar system gravitationally. The second I helped build a simulation of a wildfire in a group
            of 3 other people. In the final project at University I simulated a pendulum. <br><br> During a 3-week
            course with CodeNation, I built a text-based adventure game in 1-week in a group of 3 other people, and I
            also built the website you are viewing now. <br><br> If you would like to know more about each of these
            projects please click on the icons below to see more information and links to <a

                            2018). This was my first experience coding anything in Python. The simulation takes the
                            positions and velocities of all the bodies in the system, then using physics formulae it
                            calculates the next position and velocity vectors for the following timestep. The simulation
                            uses multiple numerical methods for comparison.

                            This was a group project with 3 other people in which we built a simulation of a wildfire
                            based on a case study from 2009. We built this from scratch and wrote a 42-page scientific
                            report on the accuracy and viability of our simulation in approximately 8 weeks
                            (January-March 2020). We developed fire spreading models and population models to simulate a
                            wildfire as accurately as possible.

                            In this project, I simulated a forced damped non-linear pendulum. In order to simulate this
                            properly, I had to use problem solving skills in order to build a set of equations to solve
                            the second order differential equation for this pendulum system.
